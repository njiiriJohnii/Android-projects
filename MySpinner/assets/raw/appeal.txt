**Appeal to the senses**

We don't often think about the ways our senses of sight, taste, feel, smell and hearing offer marketing opportunities.

People use their eyes to select and make a decision to purchase an item. 

Poor or so-so visual displays will discourage buyers or keep them looking elsewhere.

Direct marketing research confirms the importance of high quality products to customers.

The quality and visual display of your product can convince a person to become a buyer.

Color has psychological appeal to customers. Fruits and vegetables, bedding plants, herbs, honey, maple syrup and many other products all have attractive
hues that will draw customers. 

Alternating colors will assist in the appeal to the customer. 

Light also affects the appearance of product color. Fluorescent lighting, rather than incandescent bulbs, makes colors look more natural.

The taste of fresh products is an attraction for customers. Letting people sample your product is a very effective selling tactic.

People are often more willing to spend extra money on a product after they have had the opportunity to taste it. (Check with
your farm market manager to see if tasting of your product is allowed )
