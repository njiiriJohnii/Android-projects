**Product Placement**

The purpose of product placement is to arrange your products in a way that immediately entices shoppers.

The method you use will be unique to the products you are offering.

One placement scheme is to arrange the display around power and impulse items. 

A power item is a product that initially attracts customers and may be featured in advertising. 

Sweet corn, strawberries and apples are all examples of power items. 

An impulse item is a product that a customer purchases spontaneously after seeing the item displayed.

Gift packs, honey and apple peelers are examples of impulse items.

Although customers do not actually plan to buy impulse items, they can significantly improve sales.
