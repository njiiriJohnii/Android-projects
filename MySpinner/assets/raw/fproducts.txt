**Winning Display for Your Farm Products**

An attractive and inviting display is crucial for anyone selling farm products directly to customers. 

It may seem obvious that an attractive display helps sales, but the nuts and bolts of creating one may be less readily apparent.

The customer's first impression is critical, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

Displays can enhance or detract from the overall image you are trying to create, whether you are selling at
a farmers' market, roadside stand, on-farm store or other location. 

An abundant,welltended presentation will draw new customers and encourage them to buy.

A sparse, unkempt display will attract minimal attention and may be perceived as an indication of inferior products.

Develop a concept before you start setting up your display. Consider the best way to display your products.

Do some research on successful methods for setting up displays.Visit successful direct marketing operations, farmers' markets and similar
operations to study their techniques.

You will learn display techniques from any business, regardless of whether or not its product is comparable to yours. Start
taking notes. 

Ask yourself the following questions: 
Is this an attractive display? 
Am I drawn to it? 
Do I want to buy more products than what I originally came for after viewing the display? Is it easy for me
to move around? 
Do I want to come back again? 
How do I feel while visiting this establishment? 

The answers to these questions will help you develop your own display area
